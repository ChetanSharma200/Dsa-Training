# 📈 Progress Log – DSA Training

This file records **weekly reflections** on my DSA practice.
The goal is to track improvement in thinking, not just problem count.

---

## Week 1 (Jan 15 – Jan 21, 2025)

### Focus
- Arrays and basic backtracking

### What Went Well
- Understood backtracking recursion tree clearly
- Reduced unnecessary recursive calls

### Mistakes Observed
- Missed base cases in early attempts
- Overlooked duplicate handling

### Corrections Applied
- Writing recursion base case first
- Dry-running small inputs before coding

### Next Week Plan
- Subsets, combinations
- Time complexity analysis discipline

## Week 2 (Jan 22 – Jan 28, 2025)

### Focus
- Recursion patterns and pruning

### Observations
- Same mistake repeated in two problems → lack of dry-run
- Code clarity improved with helper functions

### Next Week Plan
- Medium-level backtracking
- Start dynamic programming basics
