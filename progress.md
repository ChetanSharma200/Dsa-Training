## 🧠 Problem File Standard

Every problem file follows a strict structure:

- Problem statement (short & precise)
- Approach / intuition
- Edge cases
- Time & space complexity
- Clean, readable implementation

Readable code > clever code.

## 🔗 Auto-Linked Problem Index (Live)

Each solved problem is **directly linked** to its original source  
(LeetCode / GeeksforGeeks) and its **local implementation**.

### 🔁 Backtracking

| # | Problem | Platform | Solution |
|---|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Permutations | [LeetCode 46](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/) | [Code](./Backtracking/permutations.java) |
| 2 | Subsets | [LeetCode 78](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/) | [Code](./Backtracking/subsets.java) |
