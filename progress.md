# 📈 Progress Log – DSA Training

This file records **weekly reflections** on my DSA practice.
The focus is on **thinking quality, mistakes, and improvement**, not raw problem count.

## Day 1 (Start Date: 2025-01-20)

### Problem Solved
- Permutations — Backtracking  
  Platform: LeetCode 46

### What I Learned
- Understood the basic backtracking pattern:
  - Choose
  - Explore (recursive call)
  - Unchoose (backtrack)
- Clear visualization of recursion tree helped avoid confusion

### Mistakes / Observations
- Initially confused about when to backtrack (remove element)
- Had to consciously ensure list state is restored after recursion

### Corrections Applied
- Always undo the choice after the recursive call
- Dry-ran the recursion tree for small input before coding

### Next Steps
- Solve **Subsets** to reinforce backtracking fundamentals
- Focus on writing base cases before recursive logic
